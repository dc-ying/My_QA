# PaperQA
To create a classification model for recommending selected articles. Course Work for [EE448 Big Data Mining](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ee448-paperqa).

## Instruction
In this project, you are given the answers to 19 different queries of 2k+ abstracts of the latest academic papers in the field of Artificial Intelligent. By proposing a QA model, your goal is to select a better answer from the two answers given towards each abstract and question pair. To some extend, the problem of QA is transformed into a two classification task.

## First Attempt
Since SQuAD is familiar with the given dataset. Here is my first attempt 
- [x] csv format -> json format
- [ ] use [QA-Net](https://github.com/NLPLearn/QANet)/[BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) to train SQuAD
- [ ] use [QA-Net](https://github.com/NLPLearn/QANet)/[BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) to train my data
- [ ] compare with two choices
